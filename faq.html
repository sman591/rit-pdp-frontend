Our program offers DAS staff the opportunity to take time out from providing their service to actually working on developing the skills necessary to provide the high level of service we are committed to providing to the institute and to one another.</p><ul><li class="topic">Those wishing to engage in professional development activities offered through the PDP agree to:<li>Prior to the PD (workshop, IST, small group) event:<ol><li>Discuss with their manager the PDP offerings and how they might serve to fulfill expectations for professional growth<li>Attend to registration timelines and register in a timely manner</li><li>Communicate with their coordinators to ensure their availability for the duration of the event</li><li>Be sure you are clear on the learning objectives outlined for any event you register for</li><li>Complete any preparatory work assigned by the facilitators</li></li></ol></li><li>During the PD (workshop, IST, small group) event:<ol><li>Arrive on time for the event<li>Sign in</li><li>Be present and ready to fully participate in all activities and discussions</li><li>Have completed any "homework" assigned by the facilitator(s)</li><li>Silence cell phones and put away all digital devices not in use for the actual PD event</li><li>No sleeping</li><li>Complete pretest, post-test and evaluation for every event<ul><li>CEUs and participation certificates will not be given to anyone not completing these documents</li></ul></li></li></ol></li></li></ul><p><strong>Special Note: </strong>If you are unable to attend a PD event (workshop, IST, small group) for any reason, you must contact the event facilitator(s), your manager, and the PDP coordinator prior to the event. Attendance is reported to managers following every event. <strong>Please see the DAS PDP Attendance Policy for more information.</strong></p></dd><dt>How do I develop a PD plan?</dt><dd><p>The very best way to begin to develop a PD plan is to talk with your manager. Ideally the process would start with a thorough review of your work including interpreting skills, content knowledge, cultural, ethical and professional considerations and your general career goals.</p><p>Discuss with your manager the best process for accomplishing the goals you establish (mentor, observations, study in a particular content area, participation in OR leading of an IST, workshop or small group, etc.). The PDP coordinator can help you find the right activities as well as provide suggestion/guidance on how to document your progress for appraisal purposes.</p><p>Your plan may be well addressed with workshop and IST offerings; if not, you may wish to establish a small group or investigate other creative avenues. </p><p>Talk with the PDP coordinator! There are a number of ways to address professional development goals and to ensure that your plan is documented for review and appraisal within DAS and the RID CMP.</p></dd><dt>What is a small group?</dt><dd><p>Self selected groups of up to 6 people with specific interest in a particular topic or skill set. Typically 7-14 weeks in duration during the regular academic semester or for a few sessions during exam/break weeks.</p></dd><dt>How do I put together a small group?</dt><dd><p>Small groups are a great way to address a very specific professional development need. For those individuals needing/preferring a more intimate and focused learning experience the small group is a perfect choice. </p><p>Small groups are generally comprised of 3-5 (maximum of 6) members. All members are self-selected or invited by the person establishing the group. The group members work together to establish goals and learning objectives, activities and timelines. </p><p>Anyone wishing to establish a formal small group should alert the PDP coordinator to ensure that learning objectives, participants, activities, and timelines are properly documented. Members wishing to receive CEU credits will need to complete additional paperwork. </p><p><strong>All staff wishing to participate in a small group must discuss the option with their managers and work with their coordinators to choose the best possible time to meet.</strong></p></dd><dt>What is a Workshop?</dt><dd><p>Principally, an exposure mechanism to current best practices, content, interpreting and linguistic theory, and skills focused activities, helpful/assistive technology, and cultural and professional and ethical topics. </p><p>Typically 2-6 hours in duration offered during semester/holiday break.</p></dd><dt>How do I develop a workshop?</dt><dd> <p>As with anything, workshops start out as ideas! If you have an idea for a workshop think about the when, the duration, what you will teach and how you will teach it. Then bring your idea to the PDP Coordinator. </p><ul><li>When would you like to present?<ul><li>Have several dates and times in mind in case your first choice isn't available</li></ul></li><li>Duration of your workshop?<ul><li>Consider how much material you have, activities you want to do and how long you will be able to engage your participants</li></ul></li><li>What are the learning objectives for the workshop?<ul><li>What is it you want to teach people? The PD Coordinator will help you write appropriate learning objectives.</li></ul></li><li>How will you accomplish the learning objectives?<ul><li>How will you teach what you want folks to know?</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Be sure your manager is on board with having you present then make and appointment with the PD Coordinator and you are on your way!</strong></p></dd><dt>Where can I find out information about upcoming workshops?</dt><dd><p>Please go to the <a href='http://www-staging.rit.edu/ntid/DAS/PDP/calendar/index.html'>calendar section</a> and select a workshop for more info.</p></dd><dt>What is an IST?</dt><dd><p>More in depth work with current best practices, content, interpreting and linguistic theory, and skills focused activities and cultural, professional and ethical topics.</p><p>Typically 7 - 14 weeks in duration during the regular academic semester.</p></dd><dt>How do I develop an IST?</dt><dd><p>Developing an IST is very similar to developing a workshop. In addition to the what, when, and how questions, you need to determine how to pace and parcel your material so that there is a logical flow for your participants week to week.</p><ul><li>When do you want to present?<ul:li>What semester and what time of day? Most ISTs occur on Friday and times are limited.</ul:li></li><li>Duration of your IST<ul><li>7 or 14 weeks? For 1 hour/week or 2 hours/week?</li></ul></li><li>What are the learning objectives?</li><li>How will you accomplish the learning objectives?</li></ul><p><strong>Be sure your manager is on board with having you present then make and appointment with the PD Coordinator and you are on your way!</strong></p></dd><dt>What is the DAS Seminar Series?</dt><dd><p>In answer to your request that PD be offered at times other than Friday we are offering weekly 50-minute “mini PD” opportunities. The 50-minute sessions will be scheduled at a variety of times and on different days. </p><h4 class="top-margin">50 Minutes/ That's not enough time! </h4><p>These sessions will be short and sweet! They will start on the hour and finish for folks to get to their next assignment.</p><ul><li>20-30 minutes for lecture or intro of topic<li>15-25 minutes for discussion and questions</li><li>5 minutes for evaluation and you are out the door!</li></li></ul></dd><dt>Who presents the Seminars?</dt><dd><p><strong>Anyone on the DAS staff can present!</strong></p><p>Interpreters, Captionists, Staff Assistants, Schedulers, Coordinators, Managers Directors, Deans, Apprentices, Students… ANYONE! We ALL have something to offer!</p></dd><dt>What topics can be/are offered?</dt><dd><p>Use your imagination but keep it current, and related to the field of Access Services. </p><ul><li>Present your research<li>Content-focused discussion related to your area</li><li>Best Practices in interpreting, captioning, note taking, etc.</li><li>Wellness topics/activities</li><li>Your favorite interpreting model,</li><li>Great apps or websites you have found that help you prep</li><li>Department information</li><li>Professional ethics, dress, etc.</li><li>How to write the “perfect” confirmation email</li><li>How to manage your email for optimal success</li><li>What’s the sign for 'x'?</li></li></ul></dd><dt>Who can attend?</dt><dd><p>Anyone available at the time of the presentation! Seminars topics will be solicited week 1 and 2, scheduling will occur week 3 and the seminars will be held weeks 4-9. </p><p>ALL sessions will be digitally recorded for later viewing!</p></dd><dt>Will CEUs be available?</dt><dd><p>For SOME seminars, yes but not for all. It depends on the topic and if there are clear learning objectives defined by the presenter. No matter what, these offer a good chance to learn something!</p><p>CEUs will be awarded using the RID PINRA form. certified interpreters wanting CEU credit will need to fill out a PINRA as well as an evaluation.</p></dd><dt>How will I know when the seminar is happening?</dt><dd><p>The seminars will be announced on the PDP Website Calendar and will run weeks 4-14 during the academic year. Check the calendar for date, time and location!</p><p>Look for email blasts! Check out the posters hung in the Mail Rooms and on the PDP bulletin Board.</p></dd><dt>I want to present! How do I get on the calendar?</dt><dd><p>Send an email to daspd@rit.edu by Friday of week 2. Include the following information:</p><ul><li>Topic/title of your information<li>A brief description of your event to be used for advertising purposes.</li><li>Days and times you are available to present (specific dates will be honored if possible)</li><li>Any special equipment and room requirements</li></li></ul><p>You will receive a return email confirming your presentation time, day and date.</p></dd><dt>What are Student/Intern/Apprentice colloquiums?</dt><dd><p>A forum for the newest members of the profession and department. The group meets weekly during the semester to discuss issues and learn about resources and strategies and to discuss best practices and current topics in the field.</p></dd><dt>How do I determine which PD events to attend?</dt><dd><p>Consider your goals for the year! Are you wanting or needing to focus on a specific skill set? Are you in need of content knowledge in a specific area? Talk with your manager to see what they say about the types of PD you should engage in. </p><p>Come and talk with the PDP Coordinator to discuss how the PD events offered might fit in to your plan or if there might be other avenues for you to pursue.</p></dd><dt>Who can participate in DAS PD events?</dt><dd><p>Anyone employed by the DAS has the opportunity to take advantage of our PD events: Interpreters, Captionists, Student interpreters, Apprenticeship Interpreters, Staff Assistant, Coordinators, and Managers. </p><p>Please read the event descriptions carefully. Information about the level of instruction and whom the event is most appropriate for will be indicated there.</p></dd><dt>What's the difference between professional studies and general studies CEUs?</dt><dd><p>The following is taken from RID Standards and Criteria Manual.</p><p>The content Areas in which Interpreters/Transliterators can receive Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are divided into two categories: Professional Studies (linguistic and cultural studies; theoretical and experiential studies; specialization studies) and General Studies (human service and leadership; general knowledge studies). In determining the content Areas, the RID PDC considered the recommended standards in the curriculum section of the Conference of Interpreter Trainers' (CIT) Educational Standards Package. </p><ol><li><strong>Professional Studies</strong> contain content that directly affects the field of interpreting/ transliterating. A minimum of 6.0 CEUs must be completed in this section during each Certification Maintenance Cycle. Examples of Professional Studies topics include, but are not limited to: <ol><li>Linguistic and Cultural Studies: The study of any language or linguistic system, as well as general cultural studies, and the study of any specific culture. Examples include:<ul><li>Advanced English vocabulary and grammar development<li>Linguistics of ASL</li><li>Linguistics of English</li><li>Language variation</li><li>Sociolinguistics</li><li>Deaf culture</li><li>American culture</li><li>Minority group dynamics</li><li>Cross-cultural studies</li><li>Multi-cultural studies, etc.</li></li></ul></li><li>Theoretical and Experiential Studies: The process of interpreting/transliterating through the application of systems of principles, philosophy, ideas or concepts. Examples include:<ul><li>History and issues in interpretation and transliteration<li>Theory of interpretation and transliteration</li><li>Skills development in interpretation and/or transliteration</li><li>Skills development in consecutive and simultaneous interpretation</li><li>Professional ethics, etc.</li></li></ul></li><li>Specialization Studies: Building skills in more narrowly focused areas within the broader field of interpreting or transliterating. Documentation must be present detailing the way in which the activity relates to the development of interpreting skills in that particular field or setting. Examples include aspects of:<ul><li>Educational settings<li>Rehabilitation settings</li><li>Legal settings</li><li>Medical or mental health settings</li><li>Substance abuse recovery programs</li><li>Technical areas</li><li>Ethics as applied in specialized settings, etc.</li></li></ul></li></ol></li><li><strong>General Studies</strong> include topics that enhance the interpreter/transliterator’s general knowledge base.There are no minimum requirements for CEUs in this category, however, only two (2) of the eight (8) required CEUs will be counted toward certification maintenance.</li></ol></dd><dt>What are the types of continuing education activities?</dt><dd></dd></dl></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="container"><div class="left"><a href="http://rit.edu" target="_blank">Rochester Institute of Technology</a><a href="http://ntid.rit.edu" target="_blank">National Technical Institute for the Deaf</a><a href="http://ntid.rit.edu/das" target="_blank">Deartment of Access Services</a><p>&copy; 2013</p></div><div class="logos"><a href="http://www.rid.org/" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/RID.png" alt="RID logo"></a><a href="http://www.rid.org/education/index.cfm/AID/99" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/ACET.png" alt="ACET logo"></a><div class="interpretek"><p>Our Sponsor:</p><a href="http://www.interpretek.com" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/interpretek.png" alt="Interpretek logo"></a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>

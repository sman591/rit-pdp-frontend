			dt How do I develop a PD plan?
			dd
				p The very best way to begin to develop a PD plan is to talk with your manager. Ideally the process would start with a thorough review of your work including interpreting skills, content knowledge, cultural, ethical and professional considerations and your general career goals.
				p Discuss with your manager the best process for accomplishing the goals you establish (mentor, observations, study in a particular content area, participation in OR leading of an IST, workshop or small group, etc.). The PDP coordinator can help you find the right activities as well as provide suggestion/guidance on how to document your progress for appraisal purposes.
				p Your plan may be well addressed with workshop and IST offerings; if not, you may wish to establish a small group or investigate other creative avenues. 
				p Talk with the PDP coordinator! There are a number of ways to address professional development goals and to ensure that your plan is documented for review and appraisal within DAS and the RID CMP.
			dt What is a small group?
			dd
				p Self selected groups of up to 6 people with specific interest in a particular topic or skill set. Typically 7-14 weeks in duration during the regular academic semester or for a few sessions during exam/break weeks.
			dt How do I put together a small group?
			dd
				p Small groups are a great way to address a very specific professional development need. For those individuals needing/preferring a more intimate and focused learning experience the small group is a perfect choice. 

				p Small groups are generally comprised of 3-5 (maximum of 6) members. All members are self-selected or invited by the person establishing the group. The group members work together to establish goals and learning objectives, activities and timelines. 

				p Anyone wishing to establish a formal small group should alert the PDP coordinator to ensure that learning objectives, participants, activities, and timelines are properly documented. Members wishing to receive CEU credits will need to complete additional paperwork. 

				p: strong All staff wishing to participate in a small group must discuss the option with their managers and work with their coordinators to choose the best possible time to meet.
			dt What is a Workshop?
			dd
				p Principally, an exposure mechanism to current best practices, content, interpreting and linguistic theory, and skills focused activities, helpful/assistive technology, and cultural and professional and ethical topics. 
				p Typically 2-6 hours in duration offered during semester/holiday break.
			dt How do I develop a workshop?
			dd 
				p As with anything, workshops start out as ideas! If you have an idea for a workshop think about the when, the duration, what you will teach and how you will teach it. Then bring your idea to the PDP Coordinator. 
				ul
					li When would you like to present?
						ul: li Have several dates and times in mind in case your first choice isn't available
					li Duration of your workshop?
						ul: li Consider how much material you have, activities you want to do and how long you will be able to engage your participants
					li What are the learning objectives for the workshop?
						ul: li What is it you want to teach people? The PD Coordinator will help you write appropriate learning objectives.
					li How will you accomplish the learning objectives?
						ul: li How will you teach what you want folks to know?
				p: strong Be sure your manager is on board with having you present then make and appointment with the PD Coordinator and you are on your way!

			dt What's the difference between professional studies and general studies CEUs?

				p The following is taken from RID Standards and Criteria Manual.
				p The content Areas in which Interpreters/Transliterators can receive Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are divided into two categories: Professional Studies (linguistic and cultural studies; theoretical and experiential studies; specialization studies) and General Studies (human service and leadership; general knowledge studies). In determining the content Areas, the RID PDC considered the recommended standards in the curriculum section of the Conference of Interpreter Trainers' (CIT) Educational Standards Package. 
				ol
					li <strong>Professional Studies</strong> contain content that directly affects the field of interpreting/ transliterating. A minimum of 6.0 CEUs must be completed in this section during each Certification Maintenance Cycle. Examples of Professional Studies topics include, but are not limited to: 
						ol
							li Linguistic and Cultural Studies: The study of any language or linguistic system, as well as general cultural studies, and the study of any specific culture. Examples include:
								ul: li Advanced English vocabulary and grammar development
									li Linguistics of ASL
									li Linguistics of English
									li Language variation
									li Sociolinguistics
									li Deaf culture
									li American culture
									li Minority group dynamics
									li Cross-cultural studies
									li Multi-cultural studies, etc.
							li Theoretical and Experiential Studies: The process of interpreting/transliterating through the application of systems of principles, philosophy, ideas or concepts. Examples include:
								ul: li History and issues in interpretation and transliteration
									li Theory of interpretation and transliteration
									li Skills development in interpretation and/or transliteration
									li Skills development in consecutive and simultaneous interpretation
									li Professional ethics, etc.
							li Specialization Studies: Building skills in more narrowly focused areas within the broader field of interpreting or transliterating. Documentation must be present detailing the way in which the activity relates to the development of interpreting skills in that particular field or setting. Examples include aspects of:
								ul: li Educational settings
									li Rehabilitation settings
									li Legal settings
									li Medical or mental health settings
									li Substance abuse recovery programs
									li Technical areas
									li Ethics as applied in specialized settings, etc.
					li <strong>General Studies</strong> include topics that enhance the interpreter/transliterator’s general knowledge base.There are no minimum requirements for CEUs in this category, however, only two (2) of the eight (8) required CEUs will be counted toward certification maintenance.

                <h4>DAS PDP Participation Guidelines:</h4>
                <p>Professional Development activities are designed with you in mind.

                <p><strong>Special Note: </strong>If you are unable to attend a PD event (workshop, IST, small group) for any reason, you must contact the event facilitator(s), your manager, and the PDP coordinator prior to the event.

              </dd>
              <dt>How do I develop a PD plan?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The very best way to begin to develop a PD plan is to talk with your manager. Ideally the process would start with a thorough review of your work including interpreting skills, content knowledge, cultural, ethical and professional considerations and your general career goals.</p>
                <p>Discuss with your manager the best process for accomplishing the goals you establish (mentor, observations, study in a particular content area, participation in OR leading of an IST, workshop or small group, etc.). The PDP coordinator can help you find the right activities as well as provide suggestion/guidance on how to document your progress for appraisal purposes.</p>
                <p>Your plan may be well addressed with workshop and IST offerings; if not, you may wish to establish a small group or investigate other creative avenues. </p>
                <p>Talk with the PDP coordinator! There are a number of ways to address professional development goals and to ensure that your plan is documented for review and appraisal within DAS and the RID CMP.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>What is a small group?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Self selected groups of up to 6 people with specific interest in a particular topic or skill set. Typically 7-14 weeks in duration during the regular academic semester or for a few sessions during exam/break weeks.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>How do I put together a small group?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Small groups are a great way to address a very specific professional development need. For those individuals needing/preferring a more intimate and focused learning experience the small group is a perfect choice. </p>
                <p>Small groups are generally comprised of 3-5 (maximum of 6) members. All members are self-selected or invited by the person establishing the group. The group members work together to establish goals and learning objectives, activities and timelines. </p>
                <p>Anyone wishing to establish a formal small group should alert the PDP coordinator to ensure that learning objectives, participants, activities, and timelines are properly documented. Members wishing to receive CEU credits will need to complete additional paperwork. </p>
                <p><strong>All staff wishing to participate in a small group must discuss the option with their managers and work with their coordinators to choose the best possible time to meet.</strong></p>
              </dd>
              <dt>What is a Workshop?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Principally, an exposure mechanism to current best practices, content, interpreting and linguistic theory, and skills focused activities, helpful/assistive technology, and cultural and professional and ethical topics. </p>
                <p>Typically 2-6 hours in duration offered during semester/holiday break.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>How do I develop a workshop?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>As with anything, workshops start out as ideas! If you have an idea for a workshop think about the when, the duration, what you will teach and how you will teach it. Then bring your idea to the PDP Coordinator. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>When would you like to present?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Have several dates and times in mind in case your first choice isn't available</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Duration of your workshop?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Consider how much material you have, activities you want to do and how long you will be able to engage your participants</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>What are the learning objectives for the workshop?
                    <ul>
                      <li>What is it you want to teach people? The PD Coordinator will help you write appropriate learning objectives.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>How will you accomplish the learning objectives?
                    <ul>
                      <li>How will you teach what you want folks to know?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Be sure your manager is on board with having you present then make and appointment with the PD Coordinator and you are on your way!</strong></p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Where can I find out information about upcoming workshops?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Please go to the <a href='http://www-staging.rit.edu/ntid/DAS/PDP/calendar/index.html'>calendar section</a> and select a workshop for more info.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>What is an IST?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>More in depth work with current best practices, content, interpreting and linguistic theory, and skills focused activities and cultural, professional and ethical topics.</p>
                <p>Typically 7 - 14 weeks in duration during the regular academic semester.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>How do I develop an IST?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Developing an IST is very similar to developing a workshop. In addition to the what, when, and how questions, you need to determine how to pace and parcel your material so that there is a logical flow for your participants week to week.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>When do you want to present?
                    <ul:li>What semester and what time of day? Most ISTs occur on Friday and times are limited.</ul:li>
                  </li>
                  <li>Duration of your IST
                    <ul>
                      <li>7 or 14 weeks? For 1 hour/week or 2 hours/week?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>What are the learning objectives?</li>
                  <li>How will you accomplish the learning objectives?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Be sure your manager is on board with having you present then make and appointment with the PD Coordinator and you are on your way!</strong></p>
              </dd>
              <dt>What is the DAS Seminar Series?</dt>
              <dd>

              <dt>What's the difference between professional studies and general studies CEUs?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The following is taken from RID Standards and Criteria Manual.</p>
                <p>The content Areas in which Interpreters/Transliterators can receive Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are divided into two categories: Professional Studies (linguistic and cultural studies; theoretical and experiential studies; specialization studies) and General Studies (human service and leadership; general knowledge studies). In determining the content Areas, the RID PDC considered the recommended standards in the curriculum section of the Conference of Interpreter Trainers' (CIT) Educational Standards Package. </p>
                <ol>
